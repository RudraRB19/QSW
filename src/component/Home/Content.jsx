    <h1 className='title'>PADDY THRESHER DETAILS</h1>
      <span className='content'>Threshing word literally means separation of grain
from paddy rice. The rice threshing is done by either
traditionally or with the help of rice threshing machine.
The rice threshing machine can be operated by engine,
with the help of animals, hand driven, pedal driven or
motorized. First let’s see traditional rice threshing, in
traditional rice threshing rice is threshed by beating the
buddle of paddy rice on the ground so that rice grains
gets separated from paddy easily but farmers have to
repeat this process many times because in this process
there are certain losses. The losses are rice may stick
into ground soil and there is mixture of paddy and rice
after this traditional threshing hence farmers have to
collect these both paddy and rice separately which
takes lot of time. Another disadvantage of this process
is some domestic animals may feed on rice hence its
loss of grain. third disadvantage is rice may get broken
after rice threshing many times over and over again.
Therefore it is very optimum to use rice threshing
machine for the rice threshing process because it saves a
lot of time and effort of farmers. When rice threshers
were first introduced their price was actually so high
that middle class farmers could not buy it and there was
no separate mechanism for separating rice and paddy
after the threshing is done. So our project’s main
objective is to develop a rice threshing machine
considering all these factors including cost criteria. In
our project we have reduced the cost by using standard
materials and designed a medium sized thresher which
can be affordable to all farmers.<br/>
Rice threshers which are currently in use have less
efficiency and High cost So concept is to Design
Optimum Machine With higher efficiency is a challenge.
We have solved this challenge by using separating
mechanism and using minimum material. Combining
two mechanism i.e Threshing and Separation with Two
different outputs For Rice Grains and Residue has been
combined to give optimum performance.<br/>
First process is threshing in which paddy rice bundle is
placed on paddy feed tray . The portion of paddy rice
bundle which is to be threshed starts threshing. Some of
rice and paddy during threshing gets separated but due
to hit from peg tooths of thresher drum they get
scattered all around in different direction. This
scattered rice and paddy may cause damage to the one
who threshing and may also result in loss hence to
overcome this phenomenon of loss we have covered it
with upper frame. Upper frame prevents rice and paddy
from scattering. Rice gets separated from paddy but
some broken paddy rice may come along with
separated grain rice through middle tray hence in order
to separate completely grain rice and paddy we have
introduced a separating mechanism.<br/>
